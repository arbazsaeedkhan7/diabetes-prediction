# Diabetes Prediction Data Science Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction Data Science Project repository! This project aims to predict the onset of diabetes in individuals using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains about more than 750 instances and 8 features (along with one target variable: "Outcome"):
- Pregnancies
- Glucose level
- Blood pressure
- Skin thickness
- Insulin level
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Diabetes pedigree function
- Age

## Objectives

- Explore the dataset to understand its structure, distribution, and potential correlations.
- Preprocess the data by handling missing values, addressing class imbalance, and scaling features.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models including Decision Trees, Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.
- Analyze feature importances to identify key predictors of diabetes onset.
- Document findings, insights, and recommendations for future reference and collaboration.

## Contributions and Feedback

Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are welcome! If you have ideas for improvements or would like to collaborate on this project, please feel free to open an issue or pull request.
